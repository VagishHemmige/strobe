}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame to be filtered.}

\item{condition}{A filtering condition as a character string (e.g., \code{"age >= 18"}).}

\item{inclusion_label}{A human-readable description of the remaining cohort after filtering.}

\item{exclusion_reason}{Optional. A label describing the exclusion criterion, which will be shown
